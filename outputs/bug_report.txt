**Software Bug Report**

### 1. Summary of Issues Found
The code had a critical bug that caused an infinite recursion in the `factorial(n)` function, leading to a `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded` exception. This issue has been identified and resolved.

### 2. Detailed Explanation of Each Fix
The fix involved adding a base case to the recursive function `factorial(n)` to stop the recursion when `n` reaches a certain value (e.g., 0 or 1). Additionally, a check was added to handle negative numbers, as factorial is not defined for negative integers. The corrected code now includes:
* A base case to return 1 when `n` is 0 or 1
* A check to raise a `ValueError` when `n` is less than 0

### 3. Impact Assessment
The impact of this bug was significant, as it would cause the program to crash with a `RecursionError` exception. The fix ensures that the function now behaves correctly and returns the expected results for non-negative integers. The added check for negative numbers also improves the function's robustness by providing a clear error message instead of attempting to calculate an undefined result.

### 4. Alternative Solutions Considered
Alternative solutions considered included:
* Using an iterative approach instead of recursion to calculate the factorial
* Implementing a more advanced error handling mechanism to handle edge cases
* Adding additional checks for non-integer inputs

However, the chosen solution was deemed the most straightforward and effective way to address the issue while maintaining the original function's intent and simplicity.
